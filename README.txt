This is conract 1, to use this program all you do is open it using PyCharm and hit the run button(or F5 key). 
To get the tiles type in grass, sand or stone and the box will appear to match the colour of the specified input.

We aim to improve the code drasticly in future by adding much more varied tiles aswell as the ability
to input multiple with different attributes.

This was coded by both Toby Atkinson and Philip Hutchings, we both took in turns doing the programming.

To use this program, the console will list out words which the user will have to type into the console and press enter.
This will then display a coloured box in the program window, with the colour assigned to the keyword which the user used in the console.

Keywords are: Grass, Stone, Sand.

More will come soon.
